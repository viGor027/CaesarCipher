# Overview

Developed a Flask-based application for ciphering and deciphering messages using the Caesar cipher with a specified shift. The project includes a feature to track the history of ciphered and deciphered messages, along with the ability to read and save this history in JSON format. Implemented with a tech stack including Flask, pytest for testing, Sphinx for documentation, and pre-commit for code quality. The primary goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with essential software development tools, emphasizing practical skills in the development process.
